## Overview
*Feed The Leader* is an incremental clicker game inspired by popular titles like *Cookie Clicker*. Players repeatedly click to feed a supreme leader, earning "Faith Points" (FP) that can be used to purchase upgrades, improve food, and acquire power-ups. The game critiques societal power structures through its mechanics while maintaining engaging gameplay.

The objective is to become the most devoted follower by earning FP and purchasing all available upgrades. Players can prestige after reaching milestones, restarting the game with base power-ups that accelerate future progress. As the leader consumes more food, his appearance changes, reflecting his growing size.

## Motivation and Concept
*Feed The Leader* was initially conceived as a project for the university course **Introduction to Software Engineering**. The choice of a clicker game was intentional to leverage its simplicity while adding a layer of dark humor. The game critiques societal power structures, symbolized through the endless consumption of the leader, offering players a humorous yet thought-provoking experience.

## Key Features
- **Simple mechanics**: Click to feed the leader, earn FP, and purchase upgrades.
- **Progression system**: Unlock better food, multipliers, and power-ups to progress faster.
- **Prestige system**: Restart the game after milestones with added bonuses.
- **Random events**: Encounter random events that provide rewards or penalties.

## Game Systems
1. **Food feeding mechanics**: Players click to feed the leader, gaining FP. Frequent feeding increases points; overfeeding reduces points gained.
2. **Quantum press mechanic**: Reduces food size, allowing the leader to consume more without losing value.
3. **Economy system**: FP is used to purchase upgrades and automate FP generation.
4. **Random events**: Occur sporadically, rewarding or penalizing players.
5. **Prestige mechanic**: Allows players to restart with bonuses after accumulating enough FP and upgrades.
6. **Visual progression**: The leader’s appearance evolves as his size increases.

## Development Process
The game was developed using **Scrum methodology**, with team members collaborating through regular meetings and task management using Trello boards. Development started with basic mechanics in Unity with C# and progressively integrated more complex systems such as achievements, upgrades, and generators. Visual Paradigm was used for diagramming and documenting requirements and use cases.

## Planned Features (Future Updates)
- **Minigames**: Unlockable to add variety to gameplay.
- **Seasonal events**: Real-world seasonal events affecting gameplay and visuals.
- **Enemy interactions**: Random enemies that impact the player based on interactions.
- **Enhanced cosmetics and customization**: Additional options for interface and game appearance customization.
