    <h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to spread the ideology of the leader.
      As loyal followers of their regime, we present their main ideas so they can be known worldwide.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
    <p>The leader’s ideas can be summed up in two:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep growing.</li>
      <li>Eliminate the evils of the world (at all costs).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, the leader begins to strive to make this world a better place by using the most powerful medium that exists in the West: <strong>progress</strong> (and competition, or the lack of it).</p>
    <h4 id="why-feed-a-leader-what-s-the-purpose-of-all-this">Why feed a leader? What’s the purpose of all this?</h4>
    <p>Maybe this breaks a little with the scheme of formal language and cheap comedy that embraces this whole game, but in the official development documentation of the game, this beautiful justification was written — totally generated by a human — which encompasses why we decided to do what we did:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>In the constant dance of clicks, in the seemingly trivial repetition, we find an echo of life itself. An incremental video game is not just entertainment; it is a <strong>reminder</strong>. Like the sun rising each day, like the waves endlessly caressing the shore, consistency is the melody underlying our existence.</em></p>
      <p><em>In the clicker, we find the paradox: the small becomes large, the insignificant becomes powerful. Every click, like a drop in the ocean, adds up and builds. So too in life, our daily efforts, though modest, shape our destiny. Persistence, like a golden thread, weaves the fabric of our stories.</em>
        <em>Increasing the currency, click by click, is a ritual that transcends the mundane. In each press, lies the promise of a brighter tomorrow. It’s not just a game, but a lesson: greatness does not arise from grand isolated acts, but from consistency, from unwavering commitment to our cause.</em></p>
      <p><em>May this game be a beacon in the night, an <strong>invitation to perseverance</strong>. May each click be a vote for greatness, a tribute to persistence. In the clicker, in life, consistency is the key that unlocks unexpected doors. Thus, click by click, we weave our personal epic, reminding ourselves that even the smallest gesture can resonate in the vastness of eternity.</em></p>
      <p><em>In addition to being an <strong>ode to consistency</strong>, our game, Feed The Leader, emerges as a window into <strong>critique</strong> of the complex <strong>power structures in contemporary society</strong>. By interacting with the seemingly simple task of feeding a supreme being, the game encourages us to reflect on the different layers of authority and submission that permeate our lives. Each click in the game can be interpreted as an act of compliance toward a figure of authority, thus creating an opportunity to critically examine how our daily actions can reinforce or challenge existing hierarchies.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I know it’s a lot. I know you’ve teared up and started questioning whether you’re even real. But don’t worry, it’s normal. It’s strange to feel so much beauty encapsulated in so few characters.</p>
