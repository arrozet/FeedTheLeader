      <description>About us JAJERJE studios is a small group made up of seven members born out of the need to fulfill a project for the course Introduction to Software Engineering. Faced with the question of what project to undertake and the indecision that plagued us, we decided (to try) to create a clicker in Unity. We had never used Unity or C#, but we still accepted the challenge. The result is what you can try on this very webpage by going to the download section!</description>
